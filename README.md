3824 Crescendo code

Repository in eterenal turmoil

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL CODE, IF THIS WORKS OR NOT IS NOT OF MY FAULT. The math used in this code (under the dir SwerveLib) is from team 4048, however I implemented the math in a completely different way. VERY big thanks to the briliant programmer at 4048 for open sourcing this code. *as of writing this readme i have not tested anything, if you can read this that probably means that it has either worked, or competition is about to begin.*
